h1. Random.org Gem

_Random integers, baked fresh daily._

This software based on Random.Org by Mike Green


h2. Summary

The Random.org Gem is a module that currently contains only one class: @RandomOrg::Integer@, which is an interface to Random.org's "random integer generator":http://random.org/integers/ service. Eventually it will also contain a class that generates sequences of random integers, corresponding to Random.org's "sequence generator":http://random.org/sequences/. Obviously, the Random.org Gem requires an active internet connection to work.

h2. Usage

Usage is pretty straightforward -- the only method is @new(min, max, base)@, where @base@ is either 2, 8, 10, or 16. The default setting is to generate a random base 10 (decimal) integer. Right now, if you choose to generate a hexidecimal integer, it will give you a string. Mostly because I'm lazy.

<pre>
	require 'random_org'
	
	int = RandomOrg::Integer.new(0, 100) # base defaults to 10, num defaults to 1 (max 1000)
	puts int.value # That's array with your randomly generated integer(s).
</pre>

h2. Dependencies

* Ruby Standard Library _(that's it)_

h2. About "Random.org":http://random.org

_From their website:_

*RANDOM.ORG* offers true random numbers to anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs. People use RANDOM.ORG for holding draws, lotteries and sweepstakes, to drive games and gambling sites, for scientific applications and for art and music. The service has existed since 1998 and was built and is being operated by Mads Haahr of the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland.
